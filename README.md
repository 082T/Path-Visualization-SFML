Buttons:
- A* - executes the Astar algorithm
- greedyBFS - executes the greedy best-first search algorithm
- Dijkstra - executes Dijkstra's algorithm
- Soft Clear - cleans tiles changed by used algorithm
- Clear - cleans all tiles in the grid
- Start - enables choosing the starting block by clicking on the grid
